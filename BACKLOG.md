The list of priority improvements for the 3W project that we intend to develop collaboratively with the community is detailed below.

* Configure GitHub resources that may be useful for our development. What resources exactly?
* Incorporate and provide in this repository html files with documentation automatically generated from docstrings. How exactly?
* Establish coding guidelines. Which one?
* Develop a `setup.py`. Is this module interesting for our project?
* Reevaluate the use of the [rolling_window.py](toolkit/rolling_window.py). Is there a better option or a newer version?
* Evaluate inclusion of specific features for hyperparameter optimization;
* Assess feasibility and benefits of using [Sklearn Pipeline](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html);
* Evaluate the use of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to facilitate the use of the 3W toolkit and the approval of contributions;
* Establish one or more time-related metrics for anomaly detection and classification.
